## Project Description
Cel shading (also called toon shading) is a type of 3D graphics that produces cartoon-like images. This is achieved by rendering an ordinary 3D model with modified shaders, which introduce artistic effects. For example, instead of a smooth shadow boundary, the shader may impose a hard boundary, so that the image looks as though it was painted by hand. The project will be done in WebGL, which will require JavaScript and GLSL graphics programming. The results will be evaluated in a perceptual experiment.
